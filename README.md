Code Together BR Weekly Challenge for beginner GitHub users

1. Fork this repository
2. Make some changes to the JavaScript file
3. Create a [pull request](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request-from-a-fork)

This is just for practice, so you really can't mess up!
